Guitar Site
===========

To run the site, do this:

```bash
npm install
bower install
composer install

grunt
```

That assumes you have Grunt, Bower and Composer installed. To install each, follow:

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Once you start the server, you can view it at <http://localhost:8000/>.
